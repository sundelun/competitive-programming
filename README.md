# Competitive-Programming
Record all kinds of common used templates and all kinds of some nice questions in competitive-programming. Feel free to explore!

The codeforces is under ACM contest mode, when I test it locally, I create a main.py file to write my code and input.txt to record all input.
To run the scripts with respect to input, run
```shell
cmd /c "python3 main.py < input.txt"
```
to test the code.
